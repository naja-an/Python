# Python Project
# Typing Speed Calculator
# The application prompts the user to type in a sentence present on the screen, after which it calculates the accuracy of the sentence typed by the user, the time taken and the words per minute. It will also show the number of correctly spelled words and misspelled words. It will be so much easier to practice when we get to see our progress in speed typing. Moreover, a game like approach of the application creates a fun environment for practice.
